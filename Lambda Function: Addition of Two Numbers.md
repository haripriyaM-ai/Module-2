# EXP 8: Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Three Numbers

## Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes three arguments `a` and `b` and `c`, and returns their sum.

## Algorithm
1. Get three integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b + c`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## Program
```
i=int(input())
j=int(input())
z=int(input())

f = lambda a, b,c: a+b+c

print(f(i, j,z))
```
## Output

## Result
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
